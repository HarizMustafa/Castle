# Castle
opengl c++ castle

This was made to learn about OpenGL C++ in the subject Computer Graphics Fundamentals

This project uses Dr.Wong Ya Ping's CGLabmain.cpp and CGLabmain.hpp

I created Assignment.cpp and Assignment.hpp

This program can generate random terrain, has a moving gate, toggle lights on/off and move around the camera.

User Manual

Toggle lighting         : F3

Download the whole project and run the CGProjAssignment2015.exe in Castle/bin/Debug

Or you can compile and build the project yourself.
